# ios-blank-icons
Small website to generate blank icons, used to move apps on iOS

# What can it do?
Sometimes on your iOS device, you would love to be able to change the location of your apps on the homescreen, but Apple only lets you reorder them, so unless you use 100% of the space, it's impossible to, let's say, put your apps on the bottom. This can be very usefull on larger phones or ipads.

The solution is to use a black background and black icons (fake apps) to move the real apps where you want. This website lets you do exactly that, and have the correct colors to get black icons (background) and gray icons (dock).

# How to use
1. Host the web page somewhere (reading from this repo directly will not work, as the link headers won't be served correctly).
2. Open the website using your iOS device and click on the color you want.
3. Click "Save on homescreen" to save an icon on the homescreen, with the selected color.

Note: Do not change the title, it is set to use an invisible special character.

# Final note
I hope iOS will let use change where we put our icons at some point...
